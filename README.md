I randomly remember the name of some youtube video I remember saving to one of my playlists. Excited to rewatch the BANGER video, i go to my 500+ video playlist 
only to realize youtube does not have a playlist search feature.....

so instead of scrolling for 5 minutes, I spent about 6 days building this tool to search my playlist instead.
